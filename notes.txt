http and https are transfer protocols. S is encrypted from user to destination


Transferring files to a web host is done with File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

I haven't worried about this yet. I just uploaded the files manually to AWS?



Domain

can get from nameboy, namecheap, etc.

.com
.something

Get your own! Get em all!

.coty
fal.coty
cotyjaneway.com
etc.

connect name to hosting?



Browser Technologies

HTML
CSS
JavaScript

Only these three! Everything else is a variation


:root  is called a pseudoclass?
it indicates this is the top of the Document


why not use html?

html has a start and an end, and root encompasses everything.
also, pseudoclasses are weighted more heavily for css over html. so now we have more control.

line-height should not have a unit, so that the browser will adust it as needed




margin: 0 auto;   is a way of centering elements on the page (along with width)

#contact {
  width: 400px;
  text-align: center;
  background: var(--necroGray);
  margin: 0 auto;
}

The above centered both the text in the element and the element itself.



This was used to make the last paragraph in the contact id have this margin. it was for a link nested inside of a paragraph.
#contact p:last-child{
margin-top: 3rem;
}





/* Media Queries */
@media(min-width: 850px) {
  nav {
    max-width: 1200px;
  }

}

Media queries seem to be more about the window size, rather than something like an http request to a site

above: when 'media' is at at least 850 px wide,
  these apply
